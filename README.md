mail-surveyor
=============

Mail surveys made easy (with a Meteor application).
**Currently no usable code**


Mail-surveyor is a web application that lets you define surveys and recipients, then mails the survey to the recipients.
It tracks their answers and provide you with a basic dashboard to follow-up.

I developed it as a way to validate software product ideas for my bootstrapped business,
and learn Meteor at the same time.

Used libraries
--------------
Like all software, Mail-surveyor stands on the shoulders of giants (big and small), and is only possible thanks to the
work of all these talented people.

[Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/), for killer, next-gen web framework.

[Iron Router](https://github.com/EventedMind/iron-router), for proper url/templates routing.

[Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/) and its [Meteor integration](https://github.com/mangasocial/meteor-bootstrap-3),
for an incredibly beautiful front-end framework.
All the beauty is theirs, the ugliness is me slowly learning it...

[Steven Levithan's date.format.js](http://blog.stevenlevithan.com/archives/date-time-format) for a _really_ compact
date formatting lib.

[Mark Otto's HTML/CSS guide](http://mdo.github.io/code-guide/), because you need consistency for sanity.
